                    which were derived from the bite of a spider genetically engineered by Spider-Man's nemesis Norman
                    Osborn in an attempt to duplicate those abilities. </p>

                    Brown, originally operating as Spider-Punk. He is a homeless teenager who was transformed by a
                    spider that was irradiated as part of President Norman Osborn's toxic waste dumping. He becomes the
                    punk rock inspired Spider-Man, leading the downtrodden people of New York against Osborn's

                <p>While being chased by other kids, Pavitr encountered an ancient yogi who gave him the power of a
                    spider to fight the evil threatening the world. While discovering his powers, Pavitr refused to help
                    a woman being attacked by several men. He left the place, but returned when he heard his uncle's cry
                    out, having been stabbed when he tried to help the woman. Thus Pavitr came to understand that with
                    great power comes great responsibility.</p>

                <p>Stone gave and Miguel accepted a drink which, unknown to Miguel had been laced with the highly
                    addictive hallucinogenic drug that bonds to the victim's DNA, called Rapture. As Alchemax was sole
                    manufacturer of the drug, Stone expected that Miguel would be forced to remain with the company. In
                    an attempt to rid himself of the hallucinogen, Miguel decided to try the genetic procedure, which
                    had killed Sims, on himself, as he had input his own original genetic code as a baseline. The
                    process was sabotaged by his supervisor, Aaron Delgato, in the attempt to kill him (the incident
                    would be covered up as an accident). Miguel survived the process; his DNA was spliced with the genes
                    of a spider and gained several powers, though he lost his addiction to Rapture</p>
